- 👋 Hi, I’m @The-Avian
- 👀 I’m interested in practical solutions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate when I feel more comfortable using github
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spent my learning years hands on with projects that skirted math, grammar, and programming. Now that I am starting to take those subjects more seriosly, the concepts resonate clearer due to me already attempting the 'do' part of a lot of different projects. Prior to this I knew basic Arduino programming and intermediate algebra, it helped me wtih component bench testing. Now that im learning basic HTML, im finding it's higharchy to be highly satisfying and practical for organizinng shopping and organization lists.
